        Tostones are a popular side dish consisting of twice-fried green plantains sprinkled with salt.
    </p>
    <p> <h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>green plantains</li>
        <li>vegetable or canola oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the plantains and cut them into rounds about 3/4ths of an inch thick.</li>
        <li>Fill a medium sauce pan with enough oil to cover the plantain rounds and raise it to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Place the plantain rounds into the hot oil, frying them for about 4 minutes or lightly golden. Then remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon and let them rest for a few minutes on a paper-towel lined plate.</li>
        <li>Smash the plantain rounds evenly until they are about 1/4th of an inch thick using a tostonera or the bottom of a small plate.</li>
        <li>Once flattened, return the plantains to the hot oil for a second round of frying. Remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon after 4 minutes or once they have reached a golden color and place them again on a paper-towel lined plate.</li>
        <li>Salt generously and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
